        <h1>Research</h1>

        <p>
          We are curious about questions in fluid dynamics and transport
          processes, with a preference towards those that arise in nature. Using
          a combination of theoretical and computational tools, we pursue
          research in three categories - waves and instabilities, particles and
          flows and physics of complex fluids, on occasions exploring the
          intersection of these areas.
        </p>

      <div class="row py-3 mx-1">
        <h3>Waves and instabilities</h3>

        <p>
          Oceans have a variety of length and time scale processes happening,
          which influence the physical and biological processes in them. One of
          the most important large-scale processes is the freezing of ice caps
          at the poles during winter and their melting during summer, which
          generate large-scale ocean circulations. In order to sustain these
          circulations, the ocean has to impart energy to the cold water from
          the melted ice caps. This energy transfer is attributed to internal
          waves, surface waves, tides and earth’s rotation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row mx-1">
        <h5>(a) Internal gravity waves</h5>

        <p>
          Earth’s oceans and atmosphere are inherently stratified in density i.e
          the density changes with height. Due to this stratification, when a
          small parcel of fluid is displaced, generally due to the presence of
          tides or waves on the surface, this parcel of fluid oscillates and
          generates internal waves as shown in the video below. These internal
          waves contribute to mixing in the ocean so as to maintain large scale
          circulation. The effects of IGW’s were first observed in 1893 by
          Fridtjof Nansen, where boats experienced strong resistance to forward
          motion even in calm waters. Signatures of IGWs can also be seen by
          aerial photographs of the ocean. These waves are highly nonlinear in
          nature and interact with each other giving rise to resonances and
          thereby increasing in amplitude. We study these underlying
          interactions and resonances amongst these waves.

        <h5>(b) Surface gravity waves</h5>

        <p>
          Waves on an air water interface are commonplace, occurring on a large
          scale in the oceans, to small ripples on a lake or a swimming pool.
          Surface gravity waves are an important process that is parameterized
          into global climate models, since they interact with the atmosphere
          and determine the fluxes of heat entering and exiting the ocean,
          thereby regulating earth’s weather and climate systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          These waves get generated due to wind blowing over a slightly
          disturbed interface. Gravity and surface tension tugs on this deformed
          interface to bring it back to its original flat state and thereby
          providing the restoring mechanism for the same. These waves grow in
          amplitude and break through the process of wave steepening.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formation of surface gravity waves is a complex phenomena, Miles
          (JFM, 1957) studied the growth of these waves by performing stability
          calculations, and provided a mechanism for the growth of this
          instability. Where energy is transferred from a critical layer in air
          (where the wave speed matches with wind speed) to the interface.
          Similarly a rippling instability exists due to the critical layer in
          water and finally both their viscous counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our lab, we perform linear stability calculations to identify
          parameter regimes, at which the interface gets unstable, we determine
          the rate at which they grow and perform DNS simulations to validate
          the theoretical results. While these studies are of interest to a
          scientific mind, waves also have an artistic beauty associated like
          this picture below of a popular Japanese woodblock print The great
          wave off Kanagawa.

        <h3>Particles and Flows</h3>

        <p>
          Our research is dedicated to unraveling the flow and dynamics of
          intricate complex fluids, including dry granular materials, fiber
          suspensions, particle-fluid mixtures, and assemblies of swimming
          microorganisms. These materials hold immense practical significance,
          as they are widely encountered and transported in various industries.
          Simultaneously, they present intricate scientific challenges. Our
          investigations employ a multifaceted approach, incorporating

        <h5>(a) Particle interactions</h5>

        <p>
          Gravity-driven interactions among charged dielectric spheres in a
          gaseous medium are examined, leading to surface-to-surface contact
          within a finite timeframe due to non-continuum lubrication
          interactions. Attraction is observed between closely approaching
          dielectric spheres with similar charges across various size and charge
          ratio settings. The research investigates the influence of
          electrostatic forces on the trajectories of two uncharged conducting
          spheres under an external electric field, considering hydrodynamic
          interactions. Deriving the asymptotic interparticle force under
          lubrication limits for arbitrary size ratios, it reveals the
          attractive electric force's divergence as separation approaches zero,
          overcoming continuum lubrication resistance.

        <h5>(b) Particles in vortices</h5>

        <p>
          Vortical flows are ubiquitous in various industrial and geophysical
          contexts. More commonly, these flows will be suspended with heavy
          inertial particles, for example dustdevils and atmospheric cyclones.
          The great red spot on Jupiter is an anticyclonic storm. The suspended
          particles can be rigid dust particles or water droplets, which are
          heavier than the ambient flow. Thus the heavy particles do not quite
          obey the fluid trajectory, rather deviate lag significantly due to
          their inertia. It is theoretically known that heavy inertial particles
          centrifuge away from vortical regions and accumulate in the straining
          region of the flow. We model the dynamics of inertial particles in the
          flow generated by an isolated elliptic vortex patch and study the
          dynamics of heavy particles in it. We find that the particles sample
          the flow field according to the stable and unstable manifolds. The
          inclusion of an external shear flow is found to induce chaos to the
          inertial particle trajectories.

          The instability of a thin-film suspension of micro-swimmers under the
          influence of an attractant gradient, resulting in a preferential
          swimming direction and generating an anisotropic orientation field, is
          explored. Micro-swimmers, modeled as force dipoles, reveal instability
          due to the interplay between active stress and perturbations in
          swimmer density. A stability analysis assesses how the presence of an
          interface modifies this instability, unveiling a novel mode driven by
          interface deformation due to active stress. Instabilities are
          influenced by the orientation of the attractant gradient relative to
          the interface, even in a suspension of chemotactic pullers previously
          considered stable.

        <h5>(e) Anisotropic particles</h5>

        <p>
          In surface gravity waves, an anisotropic particle exhibits orbital
          motion. A negative buoyant particle settles into a deep flow field.
          The transportation of an anisotropic particle is a complex problem
          because it also depends on the orientation of a particle. Hence,
          translation and orientation are coupled dynamics to understand the
          transportation of a particle. In this video, we observed that as a
          particle settles, its orientation changes with time and attains a
          steady orientation. Altering the orientation leads to different
          trajectories of a particle.

        <p>
          The dynamics of inertial particles in pulsatile or Womersley flows are
          crucial in understanding various physical and biological processes and
          designing microfluidic devices. We carry out collaborative work with
          Prof. Mahesh Panchagnula, Applied Mechanics IIT Madras, to study the
          transport of particulate matter using Maxey-Riley & Langevin models &
          mixing in fluid mass in the respiratory airways and understand the
          dispersion of inertial particles in an axially diverging conduits in
          the oscillating background with the focus to understand the
          interactive and individual effects of particle inertia, time
          oscillation and degree of geometry divergence.

        <h3>Physics of complex fluids</h3>

        <p>
          Fluids that possess an underlying microstructure affecting their
          macroscopic properties are categorized as complex fluids. Our interest
          lies in understanding the microstructure's influence on the fluid flow
          dynamics. Thus far, we have been working on such flows in the context
          of particle-laden falling films, dusty flows and bacterial films.
        </p>

        <h5>(a) Particle-laden falling films</h5>

        <p>
          Falling liquid films laden with particles are ubiquitous, from coating
          processes in industries to the tear film protecting our eyes. In this
          context, we studied the stability of the canonical problem of a
          particle-laden gravity-driven falling film. We found that the
          viscosity stratification created by the suspended particles could
          solely act to destabilize the fluid flow.

        <h5>(b) Dusty Vortices</h5>

        <p>
          Vortical flows with heavy dispersed particles occur in diverse
          scenarios, both of natural and engineering origins. Here, We studied
          the effect of inertial particles dispersed in a circular patch of
          finite radius on the stability of a two-dimensional Rankine vortex in
          semi-dilute dusty flow. The mechanisms driving the instability are
          characterized using linear stability analysis for weakly inertial
          particles using both 2-D and 3D stability analysis.

        <h5>(c) Bacterial Films</h5>

        <p>
          Active suspensions are ubiquitously found in a variety of natural
          systems. One of the fundamental aspects leading to the medium-like
          behavior from which the word "active suspensions" is coined, is the
          non-passivity or motility or self- propulsion of these organisms. The
          flow that is generated in the fluid medium due to the self-propulsion
          is of interest. We explore the role of geometric confinement on the
          creation of flow instabilities that eventually give rise to the
          phenomenon of collective motion. Switching from micron-sized swimmers
          to virus particles at the nanometer scale, We also explore the role of
          convective fluid motion in the aerosol transmission of diseases.
